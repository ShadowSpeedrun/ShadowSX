*Bloom intensity multiplier. Lessens the bloom effect to a more reasonable level.
*If you'd like a custom amount, then replace the second half of this code with a floating point number, in hexadecimal.
*Examples:
*0.25 : 3e800000
*0.375: 3ec00000
*0.5  : 3f000000
*0.95 : (default)
*
*I choose 67% (3f2b851f) as makes rings on Prison rivers visible like on console.  May need to make a custom code to change per stage? -Zzetti

*This option switches the X and Y button commands when in menus.  This is expected to be used with Xbox and PS controllers to better simulate menus would work in those ports of the game.

0257D8FB 00000001
